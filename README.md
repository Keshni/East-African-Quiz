# East-African-Quiz
This Java application is a simple quiz program that presents multiple-choice questions to the user. The user must answer each question within a time limit of 15 seconds. The application displays the correct answer if the time runs out or after the user selects an answer. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is shown, and they are prompted to enter their name and email address which then is saved into a csv file along with their score.

## Features
- The application utilizes a text file named tasklist.txt to store tasks. Upon the first run of the application, if tasklist.txt does not exist, it will be automatically created. Tasks are saved to this file whenever new tasks are added or existing tasks are deleted. This ensures that your tasks are retained even after closing the application.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Multiple-choice questions: The quiz presents a set of questions with four options (A, B, C, D) each.
- Time limit: Users have 15 seconds to answer each question.
- Real-time feedback: The application highlights the correct answer after each question is answered or if time runs out.
- Score submission: Users can submit their name, email, and score after completing the quiz.
